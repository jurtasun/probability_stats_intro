# i) Consider a random variable ...............................................

# Number of sixes rolling dice - binomial distributed
n <- 10
p <- 1/6
x <- 0:n
pmf <- dbinom(x, n, p)

# Plot probability mass function
plot(x, pmf, main = "Binomial distribution", 
     ylim = c(0, 0.4), xlab = "x", ylab = "pmf(x)",
     type = "h", col = "red", axes = FALSE)
points(x, pmf, col = "red")
axis(side = 1, at = 0:10)

# i) Small sample size .......................................................

# Sample size and number of repetitions
n = 10
reps <- 1000

# Initialize the vector of sample means and std sample means
sample_mean <- rep(0, reps)
std_sample_mean <- rep(0, reps)

# Loop over repetitions

      x <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)

     freq = FALSE,

# Overlay normal distribution N(0,1)

      lwd = 2,
      col = "darkred",
      add = TRUE)

# ii) Large sample size .......................................................

# Sample size and number of repetitions
n = 50
reps <- 1000

# Initialize the vector of sample means and std sample means
sample_mean <- rep(0, reps)

# Overlay normal distribution N(0,1)

      lwd = 2,
      col = "darkred",

# iii) Iterate over sample sized ..............................................

# Set sample sizes
sample.sizes <- c(5, 20, 75, 100)

# Subdivide plot panel
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

# Iterate over sample sizes

            x <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)
            sample_mean[i] <- mean(x)
            std_sample_mean[i] <- sqrt(n) * (mean(x) - 0.5) / 0.5
      }
      
      # Histogram of mean values
      hist(std_sample_mean,
           col = "steelblue",
           freq = FALSE,

           ylim = c(0, 0.8),
           xlab = paste("n =", n),
           main = "")
      
      # Overlay normal distribution N(0,1)
      curve(dnorm(x),
            lwd = 2,
            col = "darkred",
            add = TRUE)
