# Mean and variance as momenta of distribution .................................................... 

# Simulate a probability distribution (example with outcomes and probabilities)
# Suppose we have a random variable X with possible values and their probabilities:
values = np.array([2, 4, 5, 7, 9]) # Possible outcomes
probabilities = np.array([0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]) # Corresponding probabilities (must sum to 1)

# Mean as first moment of distribution
mean_distribution = np.sum(values * probabilities)
print("\nMean as first moment of the distribution:", mean_distribution)

# Variance as second moment of distribution
variance_distribution = np.sum((values - mean_distribution)**2 * probabilities)
print("Variance as second moment of the distribution:", variance_distribution)
